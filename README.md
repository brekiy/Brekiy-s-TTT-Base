Brekiy's TTT SWEP Base/Pack
==============

Introduction
--------------

This is an addon for Garry's Mod that makes changes to the weapon behavior in the TTT gamemode. It rebalances the original weapons and adds a few new ones to provide some variety in what players can use. Additionally, it makes some changes to the equipment that traitors and detectives can buy, adding new equipment and changing some of the vanilla equipment.

The focus is on the base that the guns use. This new base is mostly derived from the original TTT SWEP base and only makes a few changes.

- There is now an accuracy penalty for moving and jumping. A hard cap on the weapon spread keeps things from going all over the place and not all weapons behave the same when moving.
- There is now an accuracy bonus for crouching.
